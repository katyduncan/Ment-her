She promises that she usually writes better code than this. Her ideal qualities in a mentor would be someone who is a patient listener, appreciates functional programming and doesn't judge her by her Spotify playlists (specifically the one with mostly Nelly and Ja Rule).</p>

">Katy</a></strong> is a textbook example of an entry-level employee concerned about the prospects of finding a mentor she'd be comfortable working with. While she's got a lot of promise, she's in dire need of some support and guidance to reach her true potential and make a meaningful impact in her community</p>
